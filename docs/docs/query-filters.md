# Query Filters

Query filters allow you to describe search query modifications declaratively. It is possible to
filter, sort, paginate and build facets using query filters.

Let's describe our new document:

```kotlin
--8<-- "../samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/qf/BikeDoc.kt"
```

Now we can describe query filters for the `BikeDoc`:

```kotlin
--8<-- "../samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/qf/BikeQueryFilters.kt"
```

To apply it to a search query you need query filter parameters. They are just a mapping where keys
are a pair of filter name and an operation, and values are a list of strings. For example, it
could be transformed from http query parameters.

```kotlin
--8<-- "../samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/qf/Apply.kt"
```

After executing query we are able to process its results:

```kotlin
--8<-- "../samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/qf/Process.kt"
```

## Run a full-fledged query filters sample

JVM version:

```shell
./gradlew :samples:runBikeshop -q --console=plain
```

Native version:

```shell
./gradlew :samples:linkBikeshopDebugExecutableNative
./samples/build/bin/native/bikeshopDebugExecutable/bikeshop.kexe
```

Both versions support following environment variables:

- `ELASTIC_URL` - URL to your Elasticsearch cluster. Default is `http://localhost:9200`.
  If you want to use TLS change it to `https://localhost:9200`. Elasticsearch `8.x` and
  Opensearch `2.x` turn on TLS by default.
- `ELASTIC_USER` - user for a basic authentication. Default is `elastic`.
  Change it to `admin` if you use Opensearch.
- `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` - if this variable is set, basic authentication will be used.
  Set it to a real password of your cluster or leave empty if your cluster doesn't require
  authentication. Password for default configuration of Elasticsearch `8.x` can be found in logs.
  Default password for Opensearch `2.x` is `admin`.
