# Document source

[Document source](https://anti-social.github.io/elasticmagic-kt/api/latest/elasticmagic/dev.evo.elasticmagic.doc/-doc-source/index.html)
represents an Elasticsearch document in Kotlin. Document source is
responsible for data serialization/deserialization. For example, almost all
Elasticsearch data types can be multi-valued and a mapping doesn't reflect that fact.
But in our programs we want to operate with concrete types, as we work differently with
`String` or `List<String>`. Also all fields in a mapping are optional that requires `null`-checks
in the code. Specifying document source we can set up proper (de)serialization of underlying data.

!!! Warning
    This API is a subject to change.

Suppose we have following `Document`:

```kotlin
--8<-- "samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/docsource/UserDoc.kt"
```

## Dynamic

The most simple way to work with source documents is just to use `DynDocSource`:

```kotlin
--8<-- "samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/docsource/dynamic/DynDocSource.kt"
```

## User defined

This is the recommended way. You can explicitly specify document source:

```kotlin
--8<-- "samples/src/commonMain/kotlin/samples/docsource/custom/UserDocSource.kt"
```
